        <div class ="d2">damn we have been together 400 days I appreciate every single second that I have you . Being bao cu’s bf is an incredible feeling that I dont want anyone else have any chance to experience , that sounds so selfish but u r mine and I wont share with anyone even anh IT :)))).  There is no way I can show how much I love you just by words that why I decided to create this small website for you as an another way to reveal my love with you and also to prove that I really learn and understand what I'm going to learn in the RMIT =))))) . But all I want to say is I love you so so much and I will do everything to keep this relationship as long as possible.</div>
